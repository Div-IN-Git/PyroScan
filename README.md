# PyroScan
PyroScan is an AI-driven wildfire risk mapping system that fuses satellite imagery, thermal data, vegetation indices, terrain, weather, and human proximity to predict forest fire risk. It processes geospatial data into tiled zones and generates color-coded maps (green to red) for proactive monitoring, planning, and early warning.
